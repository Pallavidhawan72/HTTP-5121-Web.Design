# Web Design
This repository shows my projects/assignments of Web Design in my course

## Information
In this course, I learned how to create and design websites using HTML & CSS

- I'm learning how to use HTML and CSS to create and design websites in this course. I'm learning how to create elements like headings, paragraphs, photos, and links as well as the structure of HTML. In order to increase usefulness and accessibility, I'm also learning how to arrange content using various HTML tags and properties.

- I'm learning how to style these elements using CSS, modifying layouts, colors, and fonts to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices. In order to produce contemporary, adaptable layouts, I'm also investigating ideas like Flexbox, Grid, and placement. I'm learning how to build aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly websites from scratch thanks to this course.
